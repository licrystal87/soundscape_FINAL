“Dear Kobe, Thank You” is a short tribute documentary that I’ve created for Kobe Bryant, who has recently passed away due to a helicopter crash accident.
He has been one of my greatest inspirations and role models of all time. 
My vision for this soundscape narrative is to have the listeners feel inspired and motivated by Kobe’s story, and to keep working hard to one day reach their dreams and goals. 
This narrative is quite a long one (12 minutes and 16 seconds).
So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride! I promise that it will be a good one :)
